# Minesweeperjs

## About
This repo is one more copy of MinesweeperðŸ’£ðŸ§¹, written in JavaScript. I was making this project to learn JavaScript and also for fun. My experience with JavaScript is pretty limited, and I still don't know many things, that's why the code may look pretty weird. This project was made withâ™¥ in UkraineðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦.

## Features

The game has 4 difficulties: Beginner (10x10 field, 10 mines), Intermediate(16x16, 40 mines), Expert(30x16 field, 99 mines). The fourth one is a "custom" difficulty. With it, a player can change field size and amount of mines to whatever player wants. The background of the game changes through the day, from morning sky blue to midnight blue colors. The game also has sounds and high-score saving.
